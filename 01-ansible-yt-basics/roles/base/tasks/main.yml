## What is this key for? ##
# This play is going to be run as a part of the bootstrap as well. so anytime this site.yml playbook is run, this requirement is already met. 
# But we consider this kind of like a placeholder because you can use state absent to remove this key if it ever gets compromised 
# So for example, you can add a new authorized key if you have a problem with the original one(if it leaks). so you can have a play to add a new key to all your servers and then you can add that another play above existing play and set the existing play to state absent to remove this key from the servers or even just change the key if you would like thatâ€™s why we left this play here because this is just a place folder. If you want to do key management later, you can do it.
